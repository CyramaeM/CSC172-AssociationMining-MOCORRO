## 1. Project Title 
From Ratings to Rules: An Association Mining Approach to Movie Preferences

## 2. Problem Statement
-The challenge of uncovering hidden viewing patterns from large-scale movie rating datasets. In the real world, streaming platforms and cinemas face the problem of recommending films that align with diverse user tastes, often relying on incomplete or sparse rating data. Locally, this approach highlights how data-driven methods can enrich cultural engagement in communities like Iligan City, where accessible recommendations could encourage broader appreciation of films and support local cinema initiatives.

## 3. Objectives

- Develop and train a Association Rule Mining achieving target performance metrics
- Implement complete training pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, validation, and evaluation.
- Conduct experiments on this dataset utilizing association rule mining algorithms.
- By applying association rule mining, the project identifies co-occurrence relationships between movies and genres, revealing actionable insights for personalized recommendations.
